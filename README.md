# Stock Analysis
## Project Overview
We are helping Steve conduct an analysis on stock data, more specifically green energy stock data. We are to use VBA to help Steve minimize errors and run automated tasks that help Steve conduct such analysis. Because the dataset Steve wants to analyze is large, we would want to refractor the code to make the VBA script run faster. 

## Results
##### Stock Performance
As the data shows, a majority of the stocks have performed well in the year 2017 as shown in the diagram below. As represented, we presented the data and using *Interior.Color,* we displayed stocks that are having a negative performance in red and positive performance in green through the end of the year.

Similarly, we did the same for the year 2018, in which the stock performance for a majority of the dataset did not perform as well as shown in the diagram below.

##### Refractoring
As with refractoring the VBA script, the time elasped for the code to run significantly improved. Shown in the diagrams below, *Refractored Times as "VBA_Challege."*

Compared to the unrefractored code in which produced slower results as shown below.

## Summary
##### Advantages & Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
The purpose of refractoring code is to improve the structure, the design, in addition to the implementation of the code output. It helps make the code easier to understand as well as helps programmers find bugs easier and, as shown above, execute the code at a significantly faster rate. However, refractoring, similarly to making changes anywhere, could produce some new errors or bugs that did not appear before.


##### How the Advantages & Disadvantages Apply to Refractoring the Original VBA Script
As shown above, the time it takes for the code to execute significantly reduced with the refractoring of the original VBA script. By refractoring the original VBA script, we helped improve execution time as well as change the design and structure of the code to make the code easier to look at and understand.
